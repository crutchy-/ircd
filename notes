connect ircd as a normal client to irc.sylnt.us irc network

allow any number of clients to connect to ircd

ircd to work as a relay between irc.sylnt.us and local

if a local client (xchat or bot) says something, it appears as "<exec> localnick: msg" at irc.sylnt.us,
and likewise if someone says something on irc.sylnt.us






i'll try set up my little ircd script so that i can make 2 connections
to it with xchat and have the server treat both as the same nick
(using a connection hash for 2nd connection)
